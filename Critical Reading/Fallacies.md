## Definition

- A flawed argument
  - Irrelevant/Inadequate evidence
  - Erroneous reasoning or Improper Expression
- Persuasive
  - False arguments that may seem reasonable and acceptable (makes sense)

## Ad Hominem

> **Ad Hominem :** An attack on the person, rather than directly addressing the person's reasons

- Argument starts to get personal, attacks are made against a person, rather than to support an argument
- Diverts attention from the issue at hand
- Focuses on personal character of the argument source

## Slippery Slope

> **Def :** Making the assumption that a proposed step will set off an uncontrollable chain of undesirable events, when procedures exist to prevent such chain of events

## Ad Populum

> **Def :** An attempt to justify a claim by appealing to sentiments that large groups of people have in common; falsely assumes that anything favoured by a large group is desirable.

## Appeal to Questionable Authority

> **Def :** Supporting a conclusion by citing an authority that lacks special expertise on the issue at hand.

## Appeal to Emotions

> **Def :** The use of emotionally charged language to distract readers, and listeners from relevant reasons and evidence. Common emotions appealed to are fear, hope, patriotism, pity and sympathy.

- Some terms will generate negative emotions

## Strawman

> **Def :** Distorting an opponent's POV so that it is easy to attack; thus the attack is on a POV that does not exist.

## False Dilemma / Either-or

> **Def :** Assuming only 2 alternatives when there are more than 2.

Phrases include:

- Because A did not work, only B will work
- The only alternative is....
- Either this or that

## Red Herring / Smoke Screen / Wild goose Chase

> **Def :** An irrelevant topic is presented to divert attention from the original issue and help to win an argument by shifting attention away from the argument and to another issue.

## Begging the Question

> **Def :** A conclusion is supported by itself; only the words have been changed (restate the conclusion using different words).

## Hasty Generalization

> **Def :** A conclusion is not logically justified by sufficient or unbiased evidence (small sample) - weak support for the conclusion.

## Sweeping Generalization

> **Def :** Apply a general rule to a specific instance (without proper evidence).

- Use of statistics
- Take a general rule, and apply it to a case to which, due to the specific features of the case, the rule does not apply

## Appeal to Fear / Argumentum ad metum

> **Def :** Fear is used as the primary motivator to get others to accept an.

## False Cause (Post Hoc)

> **Def :** Committed when an argument mistakenly attempts to establish a causal connection.

## Post hoc ergo propter hoc ("After this therefore because of this")

> **Def :** Arguing that one event was caused by another event merely because it occurred after that event.

## Non causa pro causa ("no cause for a cause")

> **Def :** Making a mistake about the ascription (attribution) of some cause to an effect.

## False Analogy

> **Def :** Compares 2 things that are not alike in significant respects or have critical points of difference.

## Bandwagon

> **Def :** Assumption that the opinion of the majority is always valid: that is, everyone believes it, so you should too.
